# Arrays

##### A) Definition of an array:
each identified by at least one array index or key. An array is stored such that the position of each element can be computed from its index tuple by a mathematical formula.The simplest type of data structure is a linear array, also called one-dimensional array.

*For example*: an array of 10 32-bit (4-byte) integer variables, with indices 0 through 9, may be stored as 10 words at memory addresses 2000, 2004, 2008, ..., 2036, so that the element with index i has the address 2000 + (i Ã— 4).
