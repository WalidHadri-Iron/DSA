# DSA (Data-Structures and Algortihms)
## Description

This repository is for algorithmics and dealing with data-structres. 
  1. In the section Algo Review, I summed up the most important notions that I have learnerd when dealing with algorithmics and data structures
  2. In the section EulerProject, I am saving all my solutions for the problems in the awesome website for algorithmics and number theory [Euler project](https://projecteuler.net/archives)
